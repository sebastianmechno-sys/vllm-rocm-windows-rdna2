"""Out-of-tree vLLM platform plugin for native Windows + AMD ROCm (RDNA3 / gfx1100).

vLLM resolves the active platform by calling every registered `vllm.platform_plugins`
entry point; a plugin returning a class qualname wins over the built-in detectors.
On native Windows the built-in ROCm detector fails (it needs the `amdsmi` package, which
is Linux-only), and the CUDA detector fails (torch.version.cuda is None on a HIP build),
so without this plugin vLLM falls back to UnspecifiedPlatform. This plugin forces our
WindowsRocmPlatform whenever we are on win32 with a HIP-enabled torch.
